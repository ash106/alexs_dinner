# Alex's Dinner

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ash106/alexs_dinner/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ash106/alexs_dinner)

[Alex's Dinner](https://alexsdinner.herokuapp.com/) is a basic CRUD app and API which serves data for the [What Did Alex Eat Today?](https://github.com/ash106/what_did_alex_eat_today) project.

Built using:

- Rails for the CRUD app
- Postgres as the database
- Heroku is hosting the app at alexsdinner.herokuapp.com
- Grape for the API endpoints
- Rspec for tests

These tools just happen to be similar to the stack used at Unsplash. What are the chances?
